# kenOne - Browser extension
This extension allows to fill the attendance sheet provided at kenjo.io in a more easier manner. If the real attendance is not important, and you are just filling this sheet for legal purpose - this extension is for you. It comes with an entropy and a small options page.

## Stores
- [Google Chrome & Opera][google-store]

## FAQ
- **I cannot see the button?**
    - Make sure to add the attendance widget to your Home Screen
- **I still cannot see the button!**
    - Press _"Refresh"_ or <kbd>F5</kbd> - mostly, this appears after you've navigated inside the kenjo web app, and return back to the Home screen.
- **What does _Attendance: Fill Month_ do?**
    - It fills the attendance sheet for the entire month. As there is currently no way to remove entries that were made in advance, I highly discourage you to do that. Also, HR might not like it.
